### Projects

**Garbage Segregation** | Python, Transer Learning, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Garbage-Segregation-Using-Deep-Learning)
- Developed a multimodal deep learning model combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image processing and a fully connected neural network (MLP) for synthetic gas sensor data to classify waste into 12 categories.
- Integrated image data and synthetic gas sensor readings to enhance classification accuracy through multimodal learning.
- Implemented data augmentation and feature engineering techniques to improve model robustness and generalization.
- Achieved 97% accuracy on the training dataset and 95% accuracy on the validation dataset.

**Customer Segmentation** | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Ignite-ML-Intern-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-with-RFM-and-KMeans-Clustering)
- Created a customer buying behavior and customer segmentation machine learning model on RFM (Recency,Frequency, Monetary) analysis with K-Means clustering.
- Created an interactive web application with streamlit to view and visualize the segmentation output.

**Movie Recommendation System** | Python, NLP, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Movie-Recommendation-System)
- Created a content-based movie suggestion system from a 5000-movie database to recommend movies based on their content (descriptions, genres, actors).
- Performed rigorous data preprocessing and feature engineering in the process of cleaning and preparing movie data, developing study ”tags” for each movie that condensed relevant facts. Numerical tags equated to vectors using the CountVectorizer technique to analyze effectively.
- Employed cosine similarity to determine to what extent films are content-vector similar and therefore system to recommend the 5 most appropriate movies to a user’s preference.

**Twitter Sentiment Analysis** | Python, NLP, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Ignite-ML-Intern-sentiment-analysis)
- Performed Twitter Sentiment Analysis on 75000+ tweets dataset to label them as positive, negative, neutral or irrelevant.
- Executed rigorous data pre-processing, EDA and feature engineering like pre-processing and cleaning of tweets data. Transformed tweet text into numerical vectors through TF-IDF vectorization to make it analysis-friendly.
- Created an interactive streamlit web application where one can input their text and obtain sentiment analysis result.

**Email Spam Classifier** | NLP, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, NumPy<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/OIBSIP-email-spam-classifier)
- This project involves data collection, text preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. Created a web app using Streamlit for predicting if an email is spam or not.
- Implemented text preprocessing steps like stopword removal, stemming to enhance model performance. Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms.
