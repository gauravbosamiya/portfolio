### Work Experience
**Ignite Intern**<br>
*Machine Learning Intern*<br>
May 2024 - June 2024<br>
Remote
- Developed a machine learning model to segment customers and identify customer purchase behavior based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using K-Means clustering. Created a web application using Streamlit to showcase the results.
- Developed a machine learning model to analyze sentiments expressed in text and created a web application using Streamlit to predict whether the text is neutral, irrelevant, positive, or negative.

**Oasis Infobyte**<br>
*Data Science Intern*<br>
May 2024 – June 2024<br>
Remote
- Developed a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam, aiming to improve email filtering accuracy. Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation; Scikit-Learn for machine learning; NLTK for natural language processing; Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Developed a machine learning model to predict car price based on car information and built a web application using Streamlit and deployed it.

**InternCareer**<br>
*Data Analyst Intern*<br>
Feb 2024 – March 2024<br>
Remote
- Conducted in-depth data analysis on YouTube Dataset, including views, likes, comments, and subscriber growth, to identify trends and patterns.
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze terrorism datasets. It includes visualizations on key metrics such as the number of attacks, geographical distribution, attack types, and most used weapons.

**Jupical Technology**<br>
*Python Basic Technical Training*<br>
April 2023– May 2023<br>
Rajkot, Gujarat
- Throughout my internship, I honed my skills in debugging, logical thinking, and problem-solving. Developed proficiency in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and deepened my knowledge of the Python Django Framework.
- Although I had a foundational understanding of Django from self-study, the internship experience allowed me to significantly enhance my expertise and practical application of the framework.

### Projects
**Customer Segmentation** | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Ignite-ML-Intern-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-with-RFM-and-KMeans-Clustering)
- Developed a machine learning model to segment customers and identify customer purchase behavior based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using K-Means clustering. Created an interactive web application with Streamlit to visualize and showcase the segmentation results.

**Movie Recommendation System** | Python, NLP, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Movie-Recommendation-System)
- Machine Learning based Movie Recommendation system where movies are recommended based on user search.
- Collected data from Kaggle and performed data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering.
- Used CountVectorizer for text preprocessing and cosine similarity to predict movies based on that.

**Sentiment Analysis** | Python, NLP, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Ignite-ML-Intern-sentiment-analysis)
- Collected tweet data from Kaggle and performed text-preprocessing, EDA, Feature engineering, used TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numeric and then developed a machine learning model to analyze sentiments expressed in text. Created a web application using Streamlit to predict whether the text is neutral, irrelevant, positive, or negative.

**Email Spam Classifier** | NLP, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, NumPy<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/OIBSIP-email-spam-classifier)
- This project involves data collection, text preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. Created a web app using Streamlit for predicting if an email is spam or not.
- Implemented text preprocessing steps like stopword removal, stemming to enhance model performance. Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms.

**JobFind** | Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQLite3<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/job-portal-website-using-django)
- Built a job portal website named JobFind with three main modules: Admin, User, and Recruiter. Users create their profiles, apply to multiple jobs, and send messages to recruiters regarding jobs.
- Recruiters handle their profiles, job postings, user applications, and user messages.
- The admin manages both recruiters and users, reviewing and deciding on new recruiter sign-up requests, with the authority to accept or reject these requests.
