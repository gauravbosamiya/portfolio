[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/CSV-AI)
- Built a Generative AI chat system for natural language queries on CSV, Excel, PDF, and DOCX files.
- Integrated LangChain with Google Gemini API for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Used FastAPI for backend with document upload/retrieval/summarize APIs and MongoDB Atlas for persistent user-specific chat history.
- Used Pinecone vector database for semantic search, Implemented async/await concurrency in FastAPI backend to handle multiple simultaneous user queries without blocking I/O.
- Containerized backend & frontend into a single Docker image for seamless deployment.

**Garbage Segregation** | Python, Transer Learning, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Garbage-Segregation-Using-Deep-Learning)
- Used multimodal Deep Learning model integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image processing with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for synthetic gas sensor data to classify waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories (merged from 12 original classes).
- Performed EDA, image preprocessing and the data cleaning, applied data augmentation and feature engineering to improve model performance, achieving 97% training accuracy and 95% validation accuracy; validated robustness using real-world images.
- Wrote a research paper, documenting the methodology, experiments, and findings after successfully implementing the model.
  
**MLOps- Next Word Predictor** |LSTM, MLflow + DagsHub, DVC, Docker, AWS, CI/CD, Flask<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-next-word-predictor)
- Built an end-to-end MLOps pipeline integrating AWS(S3) and CI/CD with GitHub Actions, automating the entire deep learning workflow from data ingestion to model registration.
- Scraped text data from the web using BeautifulSoup and Requests for data creation.
- Trained an LSTM model on text data and deployed it using Flask containerized with Docker.
- Implemented robust logging and exception handling using Python’s logging module for smooth debugging and error tracking.

**MLOps- Sentiment Analysis** | Machine Learning, MLflow + DagsHub, DVC, Docker, CI/CD, Flask<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/mlops-sentiment-analysis-project)
- Built an MLOps pipeline integrating DVC, MLflow, GitHub Actions, and DagsHub automating the entire sentiment analysis workflow from data ingestion to model registration.
- Implemented CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions to automatically run pipeline stages, model validation, and API tests on code commit.
- Managed experiment tracking through MLflow to monitor model metrics, compare performance across versions, and streamline model selection.
- Trained a RandomForestClassifier on text data and deployed it via Flask API containerized with Docker and implemented robust logging and exception handling using Python’s logging module for debugging and tracking.

**Customer Segmentation** | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit<br>
[Github Link](https://github.com/gauravbosamiya/Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-with-RFM-and-KMeans-Clustering)
